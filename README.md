In this repository you will find our work about the Kozai-Lidov resonances in a 3-body problem : 
 - The notebook with all of our code inside,
 - the pdf of the paper from which we followed the instructions,
 -the screenshots of the figures procudeced by the code in the different folders
The notebook works for a 3 body problem but could be easilly modified to run a larger number of bodies
